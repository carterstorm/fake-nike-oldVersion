# Fake nike website - main page v1

This is the first version of the Nike website that I started creating a while ago. I was looking for an idea to create a website from scratch. I was in the process of buying new Nike shoes and I decided I would try to recreate this website :)

I created the second version of the website because I had a longer break due to the number of responsibilities at current work. Unfortunately, it was difficult for me to find my way in this project after such a long break, so I decided to start all over again.

The website was created a long time ago and forgotten, so it was not prepared to be displayed on many devices using RWD.
